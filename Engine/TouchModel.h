//  Fat-finger model for touch keyboards: which key did a touch mean? Combines where the finger
//  landed (2D Gaussian around each key's center) with how likely each key is next given the letters
//  of the word so far (vAutoSwitchNextKeyMass), mixed by the current language mode. A touch well
//  inside a key always types that key; the model only decides touches near key borders.
